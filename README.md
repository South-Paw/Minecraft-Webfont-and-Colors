# Minecraft Webfont and Colors

A Minecraft webfont kit provided with base game colors as CSS classes.


## How to use

To use this font, simply put the folders in the root directory of your project, and link the CSS as follows:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/minecraft-webfont.css" />
```

Then call the Minecraft font in your CSS with:

```css
font-family: 'Minecraft';
```

Note: changing the `font-weight` will blur the font.


## Authors

Colors used in the CSS classes are from the [Minecraft wiki](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes).
